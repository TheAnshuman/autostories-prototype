# AutoStories Prototype

## Architecture Overview

AutoStories is a prototype application designed to automatically generate and manage story content. The system follows a modular architecture with the following key components:

### System Components

- **Frontend (Client)**: React-based user interface for story creation and management
- **Backend API**: RESTful API service handling business logic and data processing
- **Database**: Persistent storage for stories, user data, and configurations
- **AI Integration**: Natural language processing for automated story generation
- **Authentication**: User authentication and authorization system

### Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js, Redux for state management, Material-UI components
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js framework
- **Database**: MongoDB for flexible document storage
- **AI/ML**: Integration with OpenAI API or similar services
- **Testing**: Jest for unit testing, Cypress for E2E testing

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn package manager
- MongoDB (v5.0 or higher)
- Git

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TheAnshuman/autostories-prototype.git
   cd autostories-prototype
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
   ```
   PORT=3000
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/autostories
   API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   ```

4. **Start MongoDB**
   ```bash
   mongod --dbpath /path/to/data/directory
   ```

5. **Run the application**
   
   Development mode:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   
   Production mode:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm start
   ```

6. **Access the application**
   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

## Test Plan

### Testing Strategy

Our comprehensive testing approach includes multiple levels of testing to ensure application quality and reliability.

### Unit Tests

**Objective**: Test individual components and functions in isolation

- Component rendering tests
- Utility function tests
- API endpoint unit tests
- Database model tests

**Run unit tests**:
```bash
npm test
```

### Integration Tests

**Objective**: Test interactions between different modules

- API endpoint integration tests
- Database integration tests
- Third-party service integration tests
- Authentication flow tests

**Run integration tests**:
```bash
npm run test:integration
```

### End-to-End (E2E) Tests

**Objective**: Test complete user workflows

- User registration and login flow
- Story creation workflow
- Story editing and deletion
- Search and filter functionality
- Story sharing and export

**Run E2E tests**:
```bash
npm run test:e2e
```

### Test Coverage

**Target**: Maintain minimum 80% code coverage

**Generate coverage report**:
```bash
npm run test:coverage
```

### Manual Testing Checklist

- [ ] User interface responsiveness across devices
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- [ ] Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1)
- [ ] Performance under load
- [ ] Security vulnerabilities
- [ ] API rate limiting
- [ ] Error handling and user feedback

### Continuous Integration

All tests are automatically run on:
- Every pull request
- Commits to main branch
- Scheduled daily runs
